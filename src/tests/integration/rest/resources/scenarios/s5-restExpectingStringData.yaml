description: 'A simple scenario for testing rest functionality. It expects the response to be valid and to contain "foo" as string body.'
actions:
    - name: rest
      responseValidation:
          - "res.toString() === 'foo'" # .toString() is necessary because currently only validations which begin with 'res.' are considered for body validation
